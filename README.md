##  Manual Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section  

1. As a user looking for pictures of places to visit in Kildare, when I land on the site, the carousel feature automatically scrolls and gives a brief description of certain scenic places to visit in Kildare. 
![title](assets/images/carousel-screenshot.png) I also have the option to scroll down to the 'Gallery' section and click through pictures there. ![title](assets/images/gallery.png) ![title](assets/images/gallery-img.png) 


2. I am a user coming to the site to explore potential attractions to visit in Kildare. On arriving at the site, I can scroll down to get some information about the area and then click on one of three filters restaurants, hotels or attractions to see what sites there are to visit. 
When I click on restaurants, 4 markers appear. ![title](assets/images/restaurant-markers.png)
On click, an info window opens containing a heading, some descriptive text about the location, a link to the location and a small thumbnail image. I can click on the link to visit the location.

3. I am a potential visitor to the area looking to ask questions about the county. On scrolling down the page, I can access a contact form where I can contact the owner with any questions I may have. When I click submit on the email form, a message appears saying email sent.![title](assets/images/email-sent-modal.png) 

## Further Testing
I have used development tools in Google Chrome to check how the website would look in different devices (portrait and landscape mode). In addition to that testing I have also asked friends and family to have a look at the website to let me know if everything looks ok on their browsers and devices.

After the tests I can see that the website displays properly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Microsoft Edge.

Problems and bugs:

In my previous submission, there was some feedback about the form accepting invalid or empty data. 
I have tested whether the email form requires proper input when being filled out. You can see here the warning message which comes up when I don't enter the email properly.

For the Carousel feature, on desktop it was working. On mobile however, the images were appearing but they were too small and surrounded by a lot of empty space. 
After refreshing the code, the space disappeared and the problem was fixed.  



No automated testing was added.
